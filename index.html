                    I built this project in C++ in Visual Studio 2022 as a passion project. <br>
                    It is currently a basic proof of concept with one monster to fight and <br>
                    a successful game loop. I have aspirations to add more monsters and <br>
                    perhaps bosses. I also would like to add a map. The game is a text based <br>
                    RPG game which is a unique niche. I do not plan on going into game developent, <br>
                    however I used this to demonstrate my knowledge of Object Oriented Programming.

                    I built this project in C++ in Visual Studio 2022 as a project for my <br>
                    Scripting and Programming class at WGU. I had a lot of fun making this <br>
                    project and it caused many lightbulbs to go off in my brain in understanding <br>
                    Object Oriented Programming the concept of a class finally made sense to me. <br>
                    The heart of encapsulation with the need for class variables to be private <br>
                    to that class made sense. It gave me the skills I needed to be able to build <br>

                    <strong class="descript">Description</strong> <br>
                    This was a project that I made for my Data Structures and Algorithms class. <br>
                    I was learned so much from making this project particularly in data science. <br>
                    Before I made this project I had not worked with CSV files before this nor <br>
                    had I parsed data that was comma deliminated. I am very proud of my implementation <br>
                    of a greedy sorting algorithm that allowed me to discover a reasonably efficient way <br>
                    to deliver all 40 packages to all 27 address with all of the special instructions on <br>
                    the packages. This was also pivotal in my understanding of programming in Python.

                    <strong class="descript">Description</strong> <br>
                    My three database management classes culminated in this project where I <br>
                    worked with a sample database located in PostGre SQL. I was supposed to <br>
                    visualize myself as a DVD store manager and answer business questions that <br>
                    would be relevant to the store using this database. This project taught me <br>
                    what it is like to work on the backend with an SQL database as well as how <br>
                    to answer business questions using simulated customer data.

                    This is a much simpler project that I made in Python but it is a significant <br>
                    project for me. I was just starting to transition into pursuit of a career in <br>
                    software development and had just finished watching most of a Python tutorial <br>
                    I made this project to prove to myself that I could make solid software and I am <br>
                    including it to remind myself how far I have come in my journey.

                    In the same vein of the Calculator project that I included, this is a legacy <br>
                    project that was from when I took a programming class during my time <br>
                    at Cairn University. I was planning on going into vocational Christian ministry <br>
                    but later pivoted into software development. I never finished this project, but <br>
                    it is a functioning model where the carrier ship can be placed and the boards can <br>
                    record shots that are fired during the game. I had a ton of fun working on this project <br>
                    and I am not sure I would have decided pursuing on software engineering without making this.

                    As I was first starting my journey of discovering my career plan. <br>
                    I went to college at Cairn University studying pastoral ministries <br>
                    and I planned to go into vocational ministry. I started a minor in <br>
                    computer science and I loved the Intro to Computer Science class that I <br>
                    took. I quickly realized that pursuing both pastoral ministries and computer <br>
                    science would be too much. After graduating Cairn University in 2023 I pivoted <br>
                    into software development and started my degree at WGU in February of 2024. <br>
                    This transition reignited my love of coding and I have been able to channel <br>
                    my passion for serving the Lord into volunteer ministry at church. I am <br>
                    more excited then ever to dive into software development. I currently work <br>
                    at Whole Foods in the bakery and my favorite part of that job is the <br>
                    creativity that I am able to cultivate which is why I plan to specialize <br>
                    in <b>front-end web development.</b>
                </p>
                <p class="threePillers" id="myStoryTextSecond">
                    I believe that my passion for software development also comes from my hobbies. <br>
                    I really enjoy playing chess which is an extremely strategic and logical game. <br>
                    Does that sound familiar? That is because software development is also very <br>
                    logical and how one uses the resources at one's disposal in software development <br>
                    makes all the difference which is quite logical. I also find much enjoyment playing <br>
                    tennis and it also helps me to stay active. Tennis is all about figuring out how your <br>
                    opponent is playing and trying to counter the way that they are playing and force them <br>
                    to play your game. The competitive nature these hobbies have fostered in me will help me <br>
                    <strong>become an amazing software developer.</strong>
